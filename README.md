## üá¨üá≠ Fun fact
I'm proudly Ghanaian and passionate about using technology to bridge gaps in education across Africa! When I'm not building iOS apps or optimizing AI algorithms, I'm thinking about how to make software more accessible to students back home in Ghana.

## ‚ö° Current Focus:
Building production-ready mobile applications and AI systems that create real-world impact - from reducing travel costs by 60% to serving 30,000+ users with improved services!
